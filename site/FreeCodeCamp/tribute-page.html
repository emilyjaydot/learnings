        <strong>1953</strong> - Her collage work was now incorporating Pollock's
        unwanted/discarded canvases. Some critics believe she was creating a
        sense of intimacy between themselves, which was lacking in their actual
        relationship.

        <strong>1956</strong> - Paints her <i>Earth Green Series</i> which
