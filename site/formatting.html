    <h2>Bold vs Strong</h2>
    <p>
      This is a content paragraph. But this information is very
      <b>important</b>, but the rest doesn't need to be emphasized.
    </p>
    <h2>Italics vs Emphasized</h2>
    <p>
      Here is another content paragraph. It also has
      <strong>important</strong> things that people should know also.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this paragraph has text that needs to be <i>stressed</i> for
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this one needs to be <em>emphasized</em> so that people understand the
      concept.
    </p>
    <h2>Small</h2>
    <p>More paragraphs, but this one needs <small>small elements.</small></p>
    <h2>Mark</h2>
    <p>This paragraph needs <mark>marks</mark> which highlights the text.</p>
    <h2>Deletions</h2>
    <p>
      This paragraph has colors someone initially chose <del>blue</del> but then
      decided on red.
    </p>
    <h2>Insertions</h2>
    <p>My favorite color is <del>pink</del><ins>blue.</ins></p>
    <h2>Subscripts</h2>
    <p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
