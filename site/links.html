    <h1>Hyperlinks on Webpages</h1>

    <p>
      Here is a content paragraph about putting links into webpages. And here is
      a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">link</a> inside of the paragraph.
      By default, links will appear underlined and blue if unvisited, and
      underlined and purple if visited. But the styles of links can be changed
      using CSS.
    </p>

    <!-- target attributes specifies where to open the linked document. -->
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"
        >This link will be opened in a new window or tab.
      </a>
    </p>

    <!-- ^Absolute URLs are the full web address. 
        Relative URLs are links to pages within the same website. -->
    <p>Here is a link to the <a href="/colors.html">Colors Page.</a></p>

    <!-- Images can also be links. -->
    <p>The picture of Libby is now a link to the Colors Page.</p>
    <a href="colors.html">
      <img src="libby.jpg" alt="Libby" style="width: 300px" />
    </a>

    <!-- Links can also create an email inside the user's email program to let them send a new email. -->
