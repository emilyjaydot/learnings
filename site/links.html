    <h1>Hyperlinks on Webpages</h1>

    <p>
      Here is a content paragraph about putting links into webpages. And here is
      a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">link</a> inside of the paragraph.
      By default, links will appear underlined and blue if unvisited, and
      underlined and purple if visited. But the styles of links can be changed
      using CSS.
    </p>

    <!-- target attributes specifies where to open the linked document. -->
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"
        >This link will be opened in a new window or tab.
      </a>
    </p>

    <!-- ^Absolute URLs are the full web address. 
        Relative URLs are links to pages within the same website. -->
    <p>Here is a link to the <a href="/colors.html">Colors Page.</a></p>
